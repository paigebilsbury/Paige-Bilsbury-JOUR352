    <h1>Do substance abuse treatment facilities offer enough effective recovery services?</h1>
    <h2>Looking closely at treatment offered in the U.S.</h2>
    <h3>By Paige Bilsbury</h3>
    <p>Data was collected from 16,066 substance treatment facilities across the United States. It is evident that most facilities routinely administer drug screening, mental disorder screening and in-patient counseling. There are lower numbers around transitional and recovery services. Recovery deals with preventing future substance use, but it may be getting overlooked. These services are even harder to offer to outpatient clients who do not receive as intimate care, making the clients more likely to need further treatment in the future. </p>
